## Nmap Network Scanning

####  scanning the IP address 216.163.128.20

```bash
nmap 216.163.128.20
```

#### trace the route that packets take from your local machine to the destination IP address 216.163.128.20

```bash
traceroute 216.163.128.20
```

#### TCP FIN scan against the IP address 216.163.128.20 . By sending a FIN packet and observing the response, the scanner can determine whether a port is open, closed, or filtered by a firewall.

```bash
sudo nmap -sF 216.163.128.20
```

#### This is an option that specifies a UDP scan, the range of ports to scan and 1->100 and the target IP address

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -p1-100 216.163.128.20
```

#### This option specifies the filename (scan_results.txt) where the scan results will be saved
   
```bash
sudo nmap -o scan_results.txt 216.163.128.20
```

#### The -oD option is used to save results in a simple "greppable" format.

```bash
sudo nmap -oD 216.163.128.20
```

#### -oG the greppable output format is designed to be easily processed by tools like grep, allowing you to quickly extract specific information from the scan results

```bash
sudo nmap -oG 216.163.128.20
```

#### use grep to extract open ports

```bash
grep '/open/' scan_results.txt
```

#### -Pn: This option tells Nmap to skip host discovery and assume that the target is online

```bash
sudo nmap -Pn 216.163.128.20
```

#### This option specifies a list of decoy IP addresses separated by commas. These decoy addresses are used to obfuscate the true source of the scan.

```bash
sudo nmap -D 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, 192.168.1.4 216.163.128.20
```

#### -A: This option enables aggressive scanning, which includes various advanced and intrusive techniques. It is a shorthand for enabling several other options, including version detection (-sV), script scanning (-sC), and OS detection (-O). The -A option is often used for a more comprehensive and detailed scan.

```bash
nmap -A 216.163.128.20
```

#### scan multiple hosts listed in a file (presumably net_home.txt). This assumes that net_home.txt contains a list of IP addresses or hostnames, with each entry on a separate line. The -A option will then be applied to each host listed in the file and save the output to a file named scan_results.txt.

```bash
nmap -A -iL net_home.txt > scan_results.txt
```

#### If you want to append the results to an existing file instead of overwriting it, you can use the >> operator

```bash
nmap -A -iL net_home.txt >> scan_results.txt
```

#### ????

```bash
nmpa -oS test.txt 216.163.128.20
```

#### ?????

```bash
nmap -oB 216.163.128.20
```

#### performs a scan on the IP address 216.163.128.20 and saves the results in multiple formats using the specified base filename "digihome." The -oA option is a convenient way to save output in three major formats: normal (text), XML, and grepable.

```bash
nmap -oA digihome.txt 216.163.128.20
```

#### The -p- option instructs Nmap to scan all 65535 ports rather than specifying a specific range.

```bash
nmap -p- 216.163.128.20
```

##  PF packet filter on macOS

#### display the current state of the packet filter (PF) rules

```bash
sudo pfctl -sr
```

#### used to add the IP address 216.163.128.20 to a table named "blockedips" within the PF firewall

```

#### used to load the PF (Packet Filter) logging kernel extension

```bash
